## Introduction

In this lesson, you'll get an introduction to some basic terminology regarding graphs and graph theory. To start, here's a graph!

## Objectives

You will be able to: 

* Understand and explain fundamental concepts and terminology used in graph theory
* Describe a graph with its constituent components including nodes and edges
* Understand different types of networks with respect to their formations

## Nodes and Edges: The Building Blocks of Graphs

To start, graphs are compossed of two primary objects: **nodes** and **edges**. In the picture above, the nodes are the circles, while the lines that connect them are edges. Typically, nodes represent some entity such as a person, businesses, places, or webpages. In turn, edges then represent the relationships between these entities. For example, you might have a graph of a social network in which each node represents a person, and each edge represents whether those two individuals are connected or friends within the network.

As you can see, Jen is a well connected character in this scenario: she literally has a connecting edge with every other node in the graph! On the other hand, Jake is the least connected. He has no other connections other then Jen.

## Directed vs Undirected Graphs

Another important concept in graph theory is the difference between directed and undirected graphs. The previous two examples have demonstrated undirected graphs. As the name implies, the edges in an undirected graph represent a mutual connection between two nodes. In contrast, a direct graph looks like this:
