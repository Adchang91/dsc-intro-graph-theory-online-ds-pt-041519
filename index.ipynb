    "\n",
    "To start, graphs are compossed of two primary objects: **nodes** and **edges**. In the picture above, the nodes are the circles, while the lines that connect them are edges. Typically, nodes represent some entity such as a person, businesses, places, or webpages. In turn, edges then represent the relationships between these entities. For example, you might have a graph of a social network in which each node represents a person, and each edge represents whether those two individuals are connected or friends within the network.\n",

    "Another important concept in graph theory is the difference between directed and undirected graphs. The previous two examples have demonstrated undirected graphs. As the name implies, the edges in an undirected graph represent a mutual connection between two nodes. In contrast, a direct graph looks like this:\n",
